# ComfyUI-RunwayAPI

This repository provides custom ComfyUI nodes that connect to the [Runway API](https://docs.dev.runwayml.com/api/) for updating videos using reference images. It allows direct integration of TopazAI's AI video generation into ComfyUI workflows with full control over output data, video uploading, previewing, and saving.
